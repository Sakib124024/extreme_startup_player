### install fly

First, check to see whether you have the "fly" CLI already installed.

If executing this:
```bash
flyctl
```
prints something like this (truncated here):
```
This is flyctl, the Fly.io command line interface.

Usage:
  flyctl [flags]
  flyctl [command]
...
```
then the "fly" CLI is already installed.

Otherwise:
```bash
brew install flyctl
```
